# Roadmap

Stonevora-ERP is being built step by step. Each phase is scoped, implemented, and
verified before the next begins.

- **Phase 0 — Foundation** ✅: multi-tenant core (tenants, branches,
  warehouses/storage locations), auth/roles/permissions, product master, universal
  UOM engine, country/currency/tax/fiscal-year config, audit trail infrastructure.
  Row-Level Security enforces tenant isolation at the database level. Public
  landing page.
- **Phase 1 — Trading/Distribution mode** ✅: Suppliers → Purchase Orders → Goods
  Receipts (with landed-cost allocation across lines by value/quantity basis and
  weighted-average cost) → Sales Orders (with a "never oversell" reservation
  guarantee against available stock) → Deliveries (dispatch, COGS capture) →
  Invoices (margin redacted per role) → Payments → Customer/Supplier ledgers.
  Not included yet (deferred, see below): Returns/Credit-Debit notes, manual stock
  adjustments, barcode/QR scanning UI, multi-currency invoicing.
- **Phase 1.x — deferred from Phase 1** (should-have, not yet built): Returns and
  Credit/Debit notes; manual stock adjustment workflow.
- **Business capability model** ✅: Stonevora is a configurable multi-business-profile
  platform, not a factory-only one. `business_capabilities` (global catalog) +
  `tenant_capabilities` (per-tenant junction, RLS-gated on `company_settings.edit`)
  let a tenant turn on only the operating modes it actually uses (Trading/
  Distribution, Wholesale/Dealer, Retail Shop, Showroom Reservation, Block/Slab
  Factory, Stone Fabrication, Tile Manufacturing, Multi-Branch/Multi-Godown) —
  reusing the existing global-catalog + tenant-junction pattern from the Phase 0
  product-attribute engine and the existing `company_settings` permission resource
  rather than adding new infrastructure. New tenants get Trading/Distribution
  (the only mode with real UI today) auto-enabled by `create_tenant_for_user`;
  every other capability is opt-in metadata via Settings → Business capabilities,
  and is marked "module UI not yet built" until its phase ships. This is the
  prerequisite the next phases build on, not a phase in itself.
- **Phase 2 — Block/Slab Factory mode**: raw block intake, cutting/processing,
  graded slab output with yield tracking and cost roll-up. Gated behind the
  `block_slab_factory` capability so it never surfaces for tenants that don't use it.
- **Phase 3 — Stone Fabrication/Projects mode**: project-based job costing
  consuming slabs, invoiced via Phase 1's engine.
- **Phase 4 — Tile Manufacturing mode**: recipes/BOM, batch production, shade/
  caliber/kiln attributes, batch-level QC.
- **Phase 5 — Showroom/Reservation mode**: reservation/hold workflow converting
  into Phase 1 sales orders.
- **Phase 6 — Accounting depth**: Chart of Accounts, double-entry ledger, P&L/
  balance sheet.
- **Phase 7 — QR/Mobile/barcode**: scanning flows for receiving, put-away,
  picking, and stocktake.
- **Phase 8 — Reporting/Dashboards**: cross-module analytics.
